            Unity C# Horror game created for a week-long GameJam in Ravensbourne university of London during October 2022

            Based on the prompt from my university of "Light and Dark", 
            this is a short maze based horror game where the game centers around collecting "Light Orbs" while
            managing your flashlight power which is needed to stave off the entity chasing the player by shining the flashlight on it.

        <p>

            The design of the game, the maze and the enemy, were inspired by pac-man and taking a more first person and creepy aproach
            to what it would be like to be in the small maze chased by relentless and functionally immortal ghosts.

            This game allowed me to experiment with the unity post-processing pipeline and using it to control
            how distorted the screen gets as the entity approaches added a lot to the horror of the game.

            This was also my first time importing blender assets and animations, so i stuck with simple meshes and designs. 
            Importing materials proved difficult but due to the simple nature of my creature design i could work quickly and efficiently around any issues.
