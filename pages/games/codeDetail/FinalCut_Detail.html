            As this was my first main project for C++ in the Unreal engine, i wanted to learn how i could make interactions between objects, and i spent a lot of time creating the
            Pick-up flash light mechanic and an object interaction component that could be added to any object to make it interactable with by the player.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Flashlight -->
    <div class="codePanel">
        <p>
			For the flashlight, as i wanted to learn how the engine worked i largely based the code off of the First Person Shooter template's rifle that can be picked up.
			I had a lot of issues with the code as i was mostly breaking it down to guess how it worked, but i was able to create a functioning flashlight that the player could pick up 
			and use effectively.

		<p>
			While an incredibly simple script, this script allows for a brief interaction through blueprints by connecting the player and the desired scripts with this script. 
			The basis of this script was to be added to any object that had a basic single function, such as picking up an item to add to the inventory of the player or interacting
			with a box to use up items in the inventory.
			It was a useful script that allowed me to think a bit more freely when implimenting, as i could this script as a basis for other simple objects i was creating and it sped up my development
			as i didnt have to add these interactions to every single script and could just add the component to the object i wanted to have the player interact with.

			What justified the use of my interaction component was my need for puzzle elements. Most simple horror games will have a "collct [object/s] to open a door" and so i wanted to add those and a few 
			of those elements to my game along with a light switch, being able to focus on individual functionality for these and use my interaction script to enable their functionality made it a lot easier
			to develop.

			The light switch i wanted to make was designed so that i could add as many lights as needed, keeping a TArray of lights that i could expand as needed that, when triggered, will cycle through and active/

			For the Fuses and Fusebox, they reference a very simple inventory component in the player to handle the inventory. The fusebox also includes a similar feature to the lightswitch,
