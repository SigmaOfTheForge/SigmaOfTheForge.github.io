            As this project was for a large group module, we had a total of 8 programmers working together to produce all the features and mechanics. 
            While primarily i focused on developing the shadergraph i also devised one of the key mobility mechanics used in the game, the grapple hook.

            This is the primary portion for my grapple hook script. When the player enters the grapple anchor's radius it enables the use of the hook, and when the player
            activates the hook it creates a spring joint between the player and the anchor to use the physics engine to control the movement, with the feel of the 
            rope being dialed in using the behaviour variables. I also used a line renderer to create the hook visually and set the start and end points to the 
            player and the anchor

        <p>
            The entire script for the anchor points. This script only stores references the player when they're within the trigger,
            sending the location of the anchor to the player so that their grapple hook script can handle the physics of the game.
            <br /><br /> Its a simple and easy method for other developers to be able to quickly understand when it comes to building the levels.
