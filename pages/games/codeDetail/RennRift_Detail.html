            As this project was for a large group module, we had a total of 8 programmers working together to produce all the features and mechanics. 
            While primarily i focused on developing the shadergraph i also devised one of the key mobility mechanics used in the game, the grapple hook.

            This is the primary portion for my grapple hook script. When the player enters the grapple anchor's radius it enables the use of the hook, and when the player
            activates the hook it creates a spring joint between the player and the anchor to use the physics engine to control the movement, with the feel of the 
            rope being dialed in using the behaviour variables. I also used a line renderer to create the hook visually and set the start and end points to the 
            player and the anchor

            The entire script for the anchor points. This script only stores references the player when they're within the trigger,
            sending the location of the anchor to the player so that their grapple hook script can handle the physics of the game.
            <br /><br /> Its a simple and easy method for other developers to be able to quickly understand when it comes to building the levels.

            For this project i was also responsible for creating a checkpoint and saving system for the game, so that players could keep their progress when they die or close the game
            <br /><br />
            This was the first time i had experimented with saving systems, so for the most part i focused on saving essential data as a class in a text document. <br />
            The class contains the index number for the last checkpoint they were at, whether this is a fresh save-file and the amount of health the player has. 
            <br /><br />
            When the level is loaded, the SaveManager checks whether it is loading a new save file or a pre-existing one and spawns the player at the corresponding checkpoint/spawnpoint
            and the player's data is saved every time they pass a new checkpoint to keep up with their progress. Whenever the player dies they are also respawned at the same checkpoint they would when
            the game is launched based on their save-file.
