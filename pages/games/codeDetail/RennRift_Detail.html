            The game is a 2D Platformer/exploration game, where the player must use a grapple hook and simple movement mechanics to explore
            and repair a spaceship containing a colony of people.

        <p>
            A segment of my code for controlling grapple hooks. The player recieves the location of grapple points when they enter the radius of the point, and loses the location when they leave the point.
            this allows the other developers i was working with to easily place objects with my devised "GrappleAnchor" script around the level and only set a few parameters, as i wanted my mechanics i made
            to be accessible and implementable by other developers.
