		<p>
			A lot of this challenge was unknown to me, having only recently begun to understand the relationships between .h and .cpp files within regular CPP console programming, being thrown into DirectX and some small
			amounts of graphics programming and matrices was a massive blockade in my ability to make a game from the base code. The original Base code provided consisted of a simple lock-picking style game with rotating
			elements and a simple arrow marker to indicate where to line things up. 
			<br /><br />
			When i was first faced with this project i felt very unsure on how to tackle the task and after some encouragement from other participants on the Grads in Games discord server i began to experiment with variables
			and commented the code to make sense of as much as i could and break down how the code worked. As best as i could understand, instances of ring objects were controled via matrix transformations to rotate in line with the
			player's inputs and when their rotation values neared the randomised roation value of the Arrow object, all of which were drawn on screen implementing from the DirectX11 framework.
			<br /><br />
			Unfortunately i didnt feel confident enough to work with more than the game.cpp/.h files, so i heavily limited the amount of control or understanding i had over the game itself. My method for converting the base project
			into a game was to hand over the game controls from the rings to the arrow, allowing it to rotate freely around the rings. From there i used the original "check if won" code to compare the angles between the 
			arrow and the active ring. Scaling up the ring using matrix transformations i was able to create the impression that the rings were heading outwards and at a certain scale, the game checks if 
			the arrow and the rings are within a certain degree of tolerance to eachothers angle, which means the player has safely made it through the ring. 
			<br /><br />
			To keep the rings cycling, i use object pooling to control only 2 rings at a time, and whenever a ring reaches beyond a certain scale it will be reset and prepared for the next round. This would have allowed me to 
			keep the game going infinitely, however i was unable to understand making my own text rendering enough to have a score display on screen and a high score, so i had to settle for the game being limited to 10 rounds.
			<br /><br />
			The largest technical error i faced was that in some instances the game would register what appeared to be a victory (where the player visually made it through the ring) as a loss. The issue stemmed from how the
			player and the rings differed in their rotation, as the player could freely rotate their arrow while the rings spawned with preset rotations within 0-2 pi. The issue as i later realised was that the player being able to
			freely rotate was that their rotation numerically could go beyond the 0-2 pi range of the rings, allowing them to visually appear the same angle but be different enough numerically that they're outside the tolerance
			by a large margin.
			<br /><br />
			Overall this challenge was a lot for me technically, and i was largely out of my depth, however i had a lot of problems that i found fun and challenging to fix despite how little i understood DirectX and the engine
			programming aspects of the challenge.
