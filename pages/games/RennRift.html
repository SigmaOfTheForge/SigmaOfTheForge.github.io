            The game is a 2D Platformer/exploration game, where the player must use a grapple hook and simple movement mechanics to explore
            and repair a spaceship containing a colony of people.

            Due to the mix of skills involved in the group project, the style is a blend of 2D pixel art and 3D low poly,
            all passed through a compression shader to stylise the world and fit together.

            As a large group project, i was assigned to work on the key systems of Checkpoints,
            save and loading and a small shadergraph system that would provide a pixellated artstyle to 3D assets.
            <br />
            I also produced the grapple hook mechanic, being mindful of others and making my code maintainable and able to be implimented by almost anyone
        </p>

            When working on the game, i was under a lot of stress to get the shader working despite numerous issues with 2D sprites and the shader graph.
            Im glad i was able to learn to a certain degree how the shader systems work in unity and to come up with creative
            solutions to the problems i faced in only a few weeks of work.
            <br />
            The checkpoint system was a vital part of the game's difficulty,
            letting the game be hard without punishing the player for slight mistakes.

            While the shader i had developed worked on my own machine, as it had issues before submission it was disabled in the final build,
            however i still feel proud of the methods i used to circumvent 2D sprites failing to write to the depth buffer.
            I used an intersecting flat plane that wrote to the buffer to cut a hole in the shader,
            and then projected what would be behind the hole onto the plane using a variant of my shader.
