            This Game is a Top-Down adventure game in the style of the Legend of Zelda series and the history of adventure games,
            consoles and the evolution of gaming itself along with my personal history growing up as consoles got better and more capable.

            The game centers around a nameless knight as he makes a solo quest into a castle in order to gain a magical artifact,
            facing demons as the game progresses in style through the Magnavox Odessey, Atari 2600, NES, SNES and DS systems.

        <p>
            Outside of the game itself, i also produced multiple pieces of cover art featuring NES, Sega MegaDrive and Atari 2600 styled cases,
            making an animation using blender which experimented with using multiple passes for effects and visuals in order to have a workflow similar to VFX for real footage.

        <p>
            As the game features evolving graphics, i had to create multiple different sets of assets in multiple different artstyles while handling all the tilemaps,
            animations and evolving game mechanics.
