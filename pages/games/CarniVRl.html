            This game is a collaborative project between myself, focusing on Network Programming and asset production, and Tung Lam, focusing on Gameplay Programming. The game
            has several small party minigames that allow for a variety of fun activities for players in a local multiplayer setting. Players use 1 PC-VR setup and up to 3 Mobile devices to play
            together.

            This game was my first time making a multiplayer project and working efficiently under another developer, being able to focus my efforts primarily on the technical aspects of the game was enjoyable and incredibly
            informative. The premise of the game is a carnival taking place on mars, showing off the latest of technology in a 1950s astropunk styled collection of biodomes.

            Network programming was one of the largest challenges I had faced. Unlike Unreal engine, Unity required a lot more work to handle replication and synchronisation, getting the players to connect in a LAN lobby required
            more work than expected and proved to be one of the biggest time-sinks for development as i spent weeks trial and error-ing my way through unity documentation to find the solutions to problems.

        <p>
            Part of my role as network programmer was to take the game mechanics developed by Tung, such as the bowling ball minigame, and get them to work across the multiplayer system and the two different devices that were used.
            It was a large headache working with these things without much prior experience but I enjoyed learning about network programming and how games manager client-server communications and synchronisations and hope
            to be able to take this game further and keep improving my skills.
