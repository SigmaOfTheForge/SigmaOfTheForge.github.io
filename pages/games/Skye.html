            2D Platformer-Shooter game made in Unity for a module covering game development in 2021, worked on as a group with 2 artists.

            I worked mostly in a team for this as the sole programmer, a lot of the direction and mechanics behind this game came from our lead artist,
            but i produced a lot of the UI elements for the game and handled asset integration along with the programming.

            The game relies on using a reticle/cursor to aim the weapon, which moves skye's arm directly towards where you're aiming and flips the character depending on the direction the player is aiming.

            This game gave me a big oppotunity to experiment with more mathematics for games than i had previously
            used along with being my first experience creating functional healthbars and objects that can be picked up.

        <p>
            Handling all of the programming and unity integration for this game was incredibly time consuming and limited the total amount of content we could make and produce.
