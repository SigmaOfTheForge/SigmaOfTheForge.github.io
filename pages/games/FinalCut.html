            A collaborative effort  between myself (C++ Gameplay Programming) and fellow student Tung Lam (Blueprint AI Programming). 
            is a first person horror game around exploring an abandoned film developing building and discovering their automated machinery hasnt quite come to a stop.

            This game was more inspired by my love of photography and physical film especially,
            with the premise being a film development studio with The Editor being made from film equipment and designed with film in mind.

            This was my first big project using C++ for the unreal engine,
            i spent a lot of time dissecting the code of the First Person Starter project to create my pick-up torch,
            batteries and interactable objects.

        <p>
            I also learned about the asset market in the unreal engine, Quixel Bridge, and how to import assets for the game using it.
            <br />
            Sequencing and animating in unreal was also a first for me and handled mostly through blueprints,
            but i found it fun to learn the tools unreal has for animating and rendering.
