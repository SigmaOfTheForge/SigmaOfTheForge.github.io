            Pure C++ and Direct X 11 project i worked on for the 2023-24 Grads in Games Rising Star Game Jam.
            Developed over the course of 3 months from November 2023 to January  2024
        </p>

            This game was an interesting experimentation and dive into the Direct X frameworks, while i have never experimented with the libraries before,
            being thrown into the deep-end for this game project was fun and an incredibly valuable learning experience.
            The Grads in Games brief for programming required using a rotation-lock puzzle C++ game as a base and expanding upon its frameworks and
            libraries to create a more fleshed out and playable game.

            The game takes inspiration from the massively popular game "Super Hexagon",
            mostly due to my limitations and unfamiliarity with Direct X and its rendering systems.

            The game plays by using a controller to move the player around in a circle, dodging expanding rings for 10 consecutive turns.

            This project had numerous hours dedicated to debugging,
            the most hours i have spent on debuggin my game were in relation to an issue with the rotations,
            where the player would be detected to lose even if they were visibly clearly inside the boundaries.
            <br />
            I later found that at the end of the debugging process that the player was rotating into negative numbers while the rings were always positive,
            a simple fix that looped from 0 to 2 Pi which did not affect the gameplay or visuals of the game.
